## Difficulty
- All levels have the same set amount of time
- Win by having the highest return on investment for the entire portfolio

## Investment Periods
- From open to open between months

## Stategies + Implementation
- Greedy: Unlike other algorithms, that consider the optimal solution over a more extensive timeframe, greedy algorithms make decisions at the given time instance.
This results in efficient computations and faster results. However, there is a downside to this approach. The greedy approach might not always provide the most optimal solution. This occurs because it considers only the current instance to make a decision.
  - Implementation:
  1. Calc Max Profit
    a. view the buy-ins and sell points
    b. take the lowest buy point and sell at the highest point after that buy point ( if there's no profitable option calc the lowest loss )
    c. calc the difference and use as profit
