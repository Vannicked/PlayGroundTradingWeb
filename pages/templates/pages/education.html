    <h1>Get Educated </h1>
    <button class="accordion">Stocks (Equities)</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p> Stocks are like owning a tiny piece of a company. When you buy a stock, you become a partial owner, and you might get some money back if the company does well.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Bonds</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Bonds are a bit like lending money. When you buy a bond, you're giving a loan to a company or a government. They promise to pay you back the loan amount (principal) with a little extra (interest) over time.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>ETFs are like a collection of different things, such as stocks or bonds, bundled together. It's like buying a variety pack that helps you invest in many things at once.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Mutual Funds</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Mutual funds are a way for many people to put their money together to invest in lots of different things, like stocks and bonds. Professionals manage these funds to help them grow.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Futures</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Futures are like making a deal today to buy or sell something in the future at a set price. It's a bit like agreeing to buy a video game when it comes out, but at today's price.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Options</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p> Options are a bit like having a special ticket that lets you choose to buy or sell something in the future. It's a choice, not a must-do. It's like getting the option to buy a concert ticket later if you decide you want it.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Trading Vs Investing</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p> Trading is like buying and selling concert tickets quickly for short-term profit. Investing is like buying a season pass for a concert series, aiming for long-term growth.</p>
